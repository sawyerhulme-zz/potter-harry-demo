## How to Use

Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jamesqquick/node-express-planetscale-and-harry-potter
```

Then, install the dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

### Option 1: Manual database setup

Then, copy the `.env.example` file into a `.env` file and populate the following properties.

- DB_USER
- DB_PASSWORD
- DB_HOST
- DB_DATABASE

> If you need a MySQL database to work with, you can quickly set one up in [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/). After you create your database, you can [create a new password](https://docs.planetscale.com/concepts/connection-strings) to get the necessary credentials for your environment variables.


Next, run the `seed.js` script to create your tables and populate them with Harry Potter data.

```bash
npm run seed
```

### Option 2: Automated database and connection setup

If you like to automatically create a PlanetScale database, seed it and configure the connectionn string in one step, execute the following command and follow the instructions on screen:

```bash
cd .pscale/cli-helper-scripts
./create-database-and-seed.sh
```

## Final step

Lastly, run the application.

```bash
npm run dev
```
